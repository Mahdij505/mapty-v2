# Mapty â€“ Workout Tracker with Map Integration (v2)
This is a JavaScript project inspired by Jonas Schmedtmannâ€™s course. Mapty is a workout tracker that allows users to log and visualize their running and cycling workouts on an interactive map using the browserâ€™s Geolocation API and Leaflet.js.
In version 2, the app introduces several new features to improve usability and control:

- Remove all workouts with a single click

- Delete individual workouts using dedicated remove buttons

- Edit existing workouts to update their details

- Close the workout form easily without submitting

Each workout displays stats like distance, duration, pace (for running), or speed (for cycling), helping users track their fitness progress visually and interactively.
